Once we install node we also install npm


npm- global command, comes with node
npm --version

we can install package as 
1. local dependency
2. global dependency

local dependency- use it only in this particular project
npm i <packageName>

global dependency- use it in any project
npm install -g <packageName>
sudo npm install-g<packageName>(mac)


THREE way to create a package json
package.json- manifest file(stores important info about project/package)
  1.manual approach(create package.json in the root, create properties etc)
  2.npm init(step by step, press enter to skip)
  3.npm init -y (everything default)

WE WILL FOCUS ON LOCAL DEPENDENCY FIRST


why do we need this package json?
we need it because we need to provide information about our project
and inside there, a very important property is the dependencies one
because in there we'll just store the dependency which our project is using
and then some packages are actually going to use more dependencies
and they will be automatically installed as well

In order to start using the module
const _=require('lodash') 
cons items=[1,[2,[3,[4]]]]
const newItems = _.flattenDeep(items)
console.log(newItems)

WHY HAVING PACKAGE JSON IS SO CRUCIAL AND SO BENEFICIAL
WHEN WE ARE STARTING SHARING
OUR PROJECT WITH OTHER DEVELOPERS?
